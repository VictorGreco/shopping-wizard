<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Product page
    
<img src="images/page_product_screenshot.png" alt="Page product">

The customer will find all the product information: **Name**, **Description**, **Categories**, **Likes**, **Previews**, **Price**.

The customer will also be able to choose **Size** and **Color** which fits better for them.
Size options updates also the pricing.

Once the customer is ready to buy the product they can **add the product to chart** or directly **buy the product**.

In case they choose the buy directly option they will go to the **next step** on the **buying process**.

### Step 1 - Address & contact Information

<img src="images/address_screenshot.png" alt="Page product">

During the first step of the buying process we require the address and contact information to the user.

We use form validation in order to check if the filled information is correct or not.

### Step 2 - Shipment Options

<img src="images/shipment_screenshot.png" alt="Shipment information">

The user can choose from 3 different shipment options:
* **Free** (72h)
* **Extra** (48h)
* **Premium** (24h)

The price and the time estimation changes depending on the shipment option.

### Step 3 - Confirm Order
